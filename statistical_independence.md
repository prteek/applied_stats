# Statistical independence

Events A and B are called statistically independent if
P(A∩B) = P(A) * P(B)
or
P(A|B) = P(A) i.e. knowing B does not change probability of A

More generally

if we have events A, B and C
if we want to check that this family is independent, then for all finite subsets j of i (2,3 in this case)
j=2:
P(A∩B) = P(A)*P(B)
P(B∩C) = P(B)*P(C)
P(C∩A) = P(C)*P(A)
and
j=3:
P(A∩B∩C) = P(A)*P(B)*P(C)


?
Does it indicate something about the relationship pf P(A∩B) < or > P(A)*P(B) ?
