# Properties of probability measure

[[Probability measure (Axioms)]]

Lemma 1.1

P(ɸ) = 0
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
If A⊂B then P(B\A) = P(B) - P(A) >= 0 , since B\A and A are disjoint
P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)
More generally, P(UAi) = ΣP(Ai) - ΣP(Ai∩Aj) + ...

These can be proven using Axioms.

Note that impossible event ɸ is Null but null events need not be impossible
