# Expectation, variance and moments

[[Discrete random variables]]
[[Continuous random variables]]

Expectation of a discrete RV:
E(X) = Σ xp(x)
whenever this sum is absolutely convergent

Expectations may not exist for some random variables e.g. Cauchy RV, Pareto

If X is an RV with a mass function p(.) and g is a function of X, g: R->R
then E(g(x)) = Σp(x) * g(x)
whenever the sum is absolutely convergent
